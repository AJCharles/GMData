# GMData
Charles (2018) Drosophila Untargeted Metabolomics MS data. Positive ionization mode data in NetCDF file format. MALDI generated data. 

The metabolomics pipeline attached is currently under development and should be considered as such. Updates with regard to functionality and ease of use are ongoing and will be re-uploaded in due course. 

> - Minimal pipeline - Most current version 
  - New pipeline - Absent of functioning significance testing with MetabR. Will integrate functionality in time.
